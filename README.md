#  Casio Website

## Introduction
A faithful recreation of the Casio India (casio.com/in/), built as a front-end development project. This clone demonstrates my ability to replicate professional website designs with attention to detail and responsive functionality.
This project recreates the Casio India website's homepage, including the navigation menu, product showcases, promotional banners, and footer elements. Built using HTML, css and JavaScript, the clone maintains the original site's visual identity and responsive behavior while providing an opportunity to practice front-end development skills.
